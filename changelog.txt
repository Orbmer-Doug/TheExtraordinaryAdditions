Bosses:
All boss attacks 'should' be more fair. Doesn't mean they're any less difficult!

Overhauled Stygain Heart:
- Resprited (no longer smooth)
- After Golem is defeated, blood moons and their enemies are empowered permanently until having an option for them after defeating Stygain Heart.
- Fixed having incorrect health
- Instead of a shield, up to three stationary masses can spawn around the fight, allowing Stygain's attacks to lifesteal

Removed Abysslon:
It was hard to make ideas and there was absolutely no motivation to continue development......
bye bye abysslon!!
most Abysslon content is still left in however, especially the music box

Overhauled Asterlin:
- New model with posable limbs (no longer stiff)
- Random attack pattern between the 3 phases. Every fight is different!

Misc:
- Added new client and server configs
- Added support for Calamity's cooldowns
	This is the primary way cooldowns in TEA are represented

Technical:
- Optimized most graphical occurences (e.g. trails behind swords, particles), there should be much less of a chance for your computer to explode
- Screenshakes are now much more smooth and natural
- Redid all unique item rarities and fixed some bugs pertaining to zoom
