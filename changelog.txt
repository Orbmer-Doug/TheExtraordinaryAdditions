Bosses:
All new death animations that make much more sense (particulary Abysslons)
Should actually sync well in multiplayer though oddities may still arise (should be nowhere near what asterlin was though lol)
All boss attacks 'should' be more fair. Doesn't mean their any less difficult!

Overhauled Stygain Heart:
- After Golem is defeated, blood moons and their enemies are empowered permanently until having an option for them after defeating Stygain Heart.
- Fixed having incorrect health
- Instead of a shield, up to three stationary masses can spawn around the fight, allowing Stygain's attacks to lifesteal

Overhauled Abysslon:
- After Moon Lord is defeated, the ocean sides of the world are cursed with water spririts until Abysslon is defeated

Overhauled Asterlin:
- Right after the Devourer of Gods is defeated, 3 special golden meteorites crash around the world...
- No longer feels a little too chatty during desperation

Misc:
- Added new client and server configs
- Added the fabled scripture to the mods name (unforseen consquences)

Graphics:
- Optimized most graphical occurences (e.g. trails behind swords, particles), there should be much less of a chance for your computer to explode
- Screenshakes are now much more smooth and natural
- Redid all unique item rarities and fixed some bugs pertaining to zoom

Stats:


Dont expect too much more updates after this one, as development has pretty much slowed down
There is one more planned boss to do in time but I feel I have been working on this mod for a LONG while now
If there is others willing to contribute I would be happy to let them join!

// should it be done? what fate will be bestowed upon my single soul if i simply ammended the words "(Cal Addon)" to the title?
// either i will be mauled to death (accusations and molten comments) or the most insignificant amount of popularity will arise idk
// maybe even put on spotlight on gitgud or gameraiders (most likely if that path is what happens)
