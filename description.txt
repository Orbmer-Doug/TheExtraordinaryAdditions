The Extraordinary Additions

A medium-sized content mod to spice up any playthrough!
Originally was made for friends but now has evolved to something truly... extraordinary...

New Bosses
2 new challenging bosses to encounter

Extended Weaponry
Numerous amounts of weapons, gadgets, and doohickeys to obtain
along with neat reworks of some vanilla weapons!

FAQ:
Does this mod work with Boss Checklist? - yep!
Is there any world generation to be aware of? - NO
But does it work in multiplayer? - as best as can be!

Everything unintentional is 100% unintentional :)

Note
The mod has no more content update plans.
Why? I want to move on to helping other mods or to even pursue game development, rather than working on a random something for 2 years.
Its aided a lot with my skills but I believe it is finally time to explore other things.
Future updates are to only stay in compatibility with Terraria and Calamity or to fix any bugs.

Hope you have just as much fun as we do!
