[h3]Note[/h3]
The mod has no more content update plans.
Why? I want to move on to helping other mods or to even pursue game development, rather than working on a random something for 2 years.
Its aided a lot with my skills but I believe it is finally time to explore other things.
Future updates are to only stay in compatibility with Terraria and Calamity or to fix any bugs.

Hope you have just as much fun as we do!
